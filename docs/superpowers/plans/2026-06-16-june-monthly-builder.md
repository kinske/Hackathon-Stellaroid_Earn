# June Monthly Builder Implementation Plan

> **For agentic workers:** REQUIRED SUB-SKILL: Use superpowers:subagent-driven-development (recommended) or superpowers:executing-plans to implement this plan task-by-task. Steps use checkbox (`- [ ]`) syntax for tracking.

**Goal:** Make the public product path clearer and add a standards-alignment proof export preview.

**Architecture:** Keep the current Next.js App Router structure. Use server-rendered public routes where possible, small client islands only for existing interactive proof/share controls, and existing tokenized Tailwind classes.

**Tech Stack:** Next.js 15 App Router, React 19, Tailwind v4 tokens, Stellar/Soroban client helpers.
