Status note: closed for pro-research intake on 2026-06-11. Checked items are either implemented, preserved in this repo, moved into repo-native backlog, or documented as external gates in `INTAKE-STATUS-2026-06-11.md`.

## Before Moving Into Repo
- [x] Move this whole folder into the target repo as `docs/spec/stellaroid` or `specs/stellaroid`.
- [x] Keep `ref/original` and `ref/extracted` with the spec.
- [x] Confirm the target repo is the Stellaroid/Soroban credential proof product.
- [x] Read `conflicts-and-gaps.md`; this archive has no standalone execution-plan Markdown.
- [x] Read `source-coverage.md` and confirm all 3 sources are present.

## P0 Execution Plan
- [x] Keep the credential proof loop as the active scope.
- [x] Do not expand into marketplace, NFT, or premature mainnet scope before proof loop is strong.
- [x] Add batch credential issuance plan.

## Admin and Trust Work

## SEO and Performance Work
- [x] Verify canonical apex domain and redirects.
- [x] Preserve strong metadata, hreflang, Open Graph, Twitter, and structured data.
- [x] Bound Soroban RPC/testnet calls with caching/API boundaries.
- [x] Reduce heavy client components, animated backgrounds, snackbars, and Framer Motion where they hurt Web Vitals.
- [x] Measure proof-page first visit and cached visit behavior.

## Evidence Gate
- [x] Proof issue, verify, revoke/suspend, and export flows are verified.
- [x] Proof-page performance is measured.
- [x] Pilot capture flow exists.
- [x] All accepted items in `all-suggestions.md` are tracked in the repo.
